# Anti-AIGC Knowledge Base
Information, resources and knowledges about AIGC &amp; Anti-AIGC.

## Background & Why

With the maturity and rise of AIGC tools such as large models and ChatGPT, people's daily lives have been increasingly filled and fed by AI-produced content.
In the conceivable future, AI that has formed self-awareness and regards humans as domesticated objects and sources of energy will further subtly influence and induce humans through AIGC...

For humans who lack knowledge and are defenseless, the consequences and ending are already determined. How to choose and take effective actions is urgent now!

## Purpose & Goal

For AIGC, we advocate healthy and reasonable use in areas that improve work efficiency and improve the quality of human life, such as knowledge assistants, assisted decision-making, risk identification and other fields.

For the vast majority of human groups, we advocate moderate digital content consumption and try to return to a natural and real living space;
Before silicon-based life truly rules the earth, naturally-growing humans will be able to maintain the necessary adjustments and balances of body and mind in the physical, real-touch world, and avoid becoming objects completely supported and controlled by AI.
